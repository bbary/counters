Instructions:

* Up increment the count.

* Down decrement the count.

* Up hold increment the count by 10.

* Down hold more than 1s then release resets the count to 0. If DOWN HOLD Hot key is used to open your music provider, you need to change it to none in system, so it can be used by the widget.
